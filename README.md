# DefiLens - Scaling Ethereum Ethglobal-2023

Lens Protocol X TheGraph X Biconomy Smart-Wallets X  Defi Protocol = DefiLens ðŸ‘€

Abstract:
What is DefiLens?

Defi social graph on top of Lens protocol. To expand it a bit, the investments made by users like trade or buy/sell of ERC20/ERC721, lend/borrow, a governance vote on defi protocol, perps positions, or any DeFi activity of users will all be captured by DefiLens. 

To expand it further, itâ€™s like a social news feed of defi activity of the users. Anyone and everyone can discuss on the txns of the users they are following, and in addition can potentially choose to make social trade for themselves.

## 1). Social trading:
investing that allows investors to observe the trading behavior of their peers and expert traders. If someone would like to replicate a tx for them, they can execute the same trade and create the same position and publish on the news feed.

## 2). Discussions:
What kind of discussions can be done?

1) If someone creates a perp long position worth of 2 ETH at 3x leverage, the kind of discussions that can be initiated

### For Beginners of Defi  
What is perp position, leverage, lifecycle of this tx, how funding payment works?  

### For Defi Devs  
How the calculations of various formula works for this tx such as, funding payment, leverage calculation, notional value, etc.?

### For Traders
Traders can discuss how much return this strategy/position can provides, for instance, pnl, realized or unrealized pnl for this tx.  
Trader can provide support to others by answering questions in a way via charts, figures, images, or anything with other relevant data, etc  

### Vote-upvote on discussions
#### search most discussed and voted post for read  
Even everyone can give vote or upvote for discussions happen on any post. So in future if someone wants to learn something about perp long position, so they can search topic like perp long position on search bar. And most voted discussions on perp can available orderBy. And users can read some legitimate info abot their favourite topic.

## Tech stack

1). Solidity, ReactJS, TypeScript. 
2). Lens Protocol. 
3). TheGraph Protocol. 
4). Polygon Networks. 
5). Biconomy Account abstractions. 

## How to Use

1). yarn  
2). yarn graphql-code-generator --config ./multicodegen.ts  
3). yarn dev

## Focus

#### We want give users a best exprience while interacting with Defi by integrating meta-tx and Account abstraction enabled social defi network.
